            <h1>Your Coding Environment</h1>

            <p>
              Although it isn't necessarily all that well covered in most introductions to programming, the environment you have
              set up to program in is very important. As there is a sea of possibilities and options out there, choosing something
              you are comfortable working with is extremely important. It is imporant that writing code, compiling code, changing
              code, refactoring, testing and running are all simple tasks, and with a good environment should never be a source of
              frustration as that in turn often leads to sloppyness.
            </p>

            <h2>Coding Environment by Components</h2>

            <h3>Editor</h3>

            <p>
              The first thing one needs to start programming is a good editor. As most of your time programming, outside of
              planning and preparing is in your editor, writing code. A good editor facilitates programming, and makes writing
              correct programs easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              An absolute minimum requirement for any editor is syntax highlighting, meaning that the editor colour text based on
              context. The next step would be autocompletion of functions and interfaces and possibly continuous syntax checking.
              These make sure that you more reliably write correct programs, and that you do not fail to compile your program
              simply because of a typo. Finally, when one gets more comfortable with the language one are using and various
              pardigmes of programming, automatic code generation will save you from wasting time on typing out lengthy syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of the above features should be available in any good IDE (which we will talk about more below), but it is also
              attainable with a good customizable editor. The two most popular and hightly customizable text editors are vim and
              emacs. As I am a vim user myself, I will quickly describe the vim setup I use when programming C++.
            </p>

            <h4>Vim setup</h4>

            <p>
              Bare vim is by itself an excellent editor, but without plugins, it does not support all of the properties we want
              from out editor. Vim comes with syntax highlighting from before, but even that can be improved upon. There are many
              resources out there to learn to love vim, so I will only focus on the plugins I use on a daily basis.
            </p>

                <p>
                  An improvement to the C++ syntax highlighting. It contains new keywords introduced by the C++11/14, as well as
                  keywords for STL and boost.

                <p>
                  The be-all and end-all vim autocomplete plugin. If set up with semantic support for C-family languages it will
                  do context sensitive autocompletion as well as on the fly syntax checking.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Set up your very own snips to use automatic code generation exactly how you like it. One can also of course
                  scour the internet and see examples of other people's snippets to get some inspiration. A great place to start
                  is <a href="https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets">honza's snippets</a>.

            </ul>

            <p>
              There are of course many more plugins that help with C++ developement, and as you encounter problems you might look
              to plugins to solve them. As an example you can find my own vim dotfiles on <a href="https://github.com/Irubataru/dot-vim">github</a>.
