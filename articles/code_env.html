            <h1>Your Coding Environment</h1>

            <p>
              Although it isn't necessarily all that well covered in most introductions to programming, the environment you have
              set up to program in is very important. As there is a sea of possibilities and options out there, choosing something
              you are comfortable working with is extremely important. It is imporant that writing code, compiling code, changing
              code, refactoring, testing and running are all simple tasks, and with a good environment should never be a source of
              frustration as that in turn often leads to sloppyness.
            </p>

            <h2>Coding Environment by Components</h2>

            <h3>Editor</h3>

            <p>
              The first thing one needs to start programming is a good editor. As most of your time programming, outside of
              planning and preparing is in your editor, writing code. A good editor facilitates programming, and makes writing
              correct programs easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              An absolute minimum requirement for any editor is syntax highlighting, meaning that the editor colour text based on
              context. The next step would be autocompletion of functions and interfaces and possibly continuous syntax checking.
              These make sure that you more reliably write correct programs, and that you do not fail to compile your program
              simply because of a typo. Finally, when one gets more comfortable with the language one are using and various
              pardigmes of programming, automatic code generation will save you from wasting time on typing out lengthy syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of the above features should be available in any good IDE (which we will talk about more below), but it is also
              attainable with a good customizable editor. The two most popular and hightly customizable text editors are vim and
              emacs. As I am a vim user myself, I will quickly describe the vim setup I use when programming C++.
            </p>
