            <h1>Your Coding Environment</h1>

            <p>
              Although it isn't normally covered in most introductions to programming, your coding environment is very
              important. As there is a sea of possibilities and options out there, choosing something
              you are comfortable working with is extremely important. It is important that writing code, compiling code, changing
              code, refactoring, testing and running are all simple tasks, and with a good environment should never be a source of
              frustration. If any of these feel like a choir, the result will always be sloppiness.
            </p>

            <h2>Coding Environment by Components</h2>

            <h3>Editor</h3>

            <p>
              The first thing one needs to start programming is a good editor. As most of your time programming, outside of
              planning and preparing, is in your editor, writing code. A good editor facilitates programming, and makes writing
              correct programs easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              An absolute minimum requirement for any editor is syntax highlighting, meaning that the editor colour text based on
              context. The next step would be autocompletion of functions and interfaces and possibly continuous syntax checking.
              These make sure that you more reliably write correct programs, and that you do not fail to compile your program
              simply because of a typo. Finally, when one gets more comfortable with the language one are using and various
              paradigms of programming, automatic code generation will save you from wasting time on typing out lengthy syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of the above features should be available in any good IDE (which we will talk about more below), but it is also
              attainable with a good customizable editor. The two most popular and highly customizable text editors are 
              <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>.
              As I am a vim user myself, I will quickly describe the vim setup I use when programming C++.
            </p>

            <h4>Vim setup</h4>

            <p>
              Bare vim is by itself an excellent editor, but without plugins, it does not support all of the properties we want
              from our editor. Vim comes with syntax highlighting from before, but even that can be improved upon. There are many
              resources out there to learn to love vim, so I will only focus on the plugins I use on a daily basis.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/octol/vim-cpp-enhanced-highlight">vim-cpp-henhanced-highlight</a> </p>
                <p>
                  An improvement to the C++ syntax highlighting. It contains new keywords introduced by the C++11/14, as well as
                  keywords for STL and boost.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> </p>
                <p>
                  The be-all and end-all vim autocomplete plugin. If set up with semantic support for C-family languages it will
                  do context sensitive autocompletion as well as on the fly syntax checking.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">ultisnips</a> </p>
                <p>
                  Set up your very own snips to use automatic code generation exactly how you like it. One can also of course
                  scour the internet and see examples of other people's snippets to get some inspiration. A great place to start
                  is <a href="https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets">honza's snippets</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              There are of course many more plugins that help with C++ development, and as you encounter problems, you might look
              to plugins to solve them. As an example you can find my own vim dotfiles on <a href="https://github.com/Irubataru/dot-vim">github</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Compiler</h3>

            <p>
              The next thing you need is a compiler so that you can turn you C++ source files into an executable program. Also
              here there are many options, but it is probably a good idea to stick to one of the common ones. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> </p>
                <p>
                  The default C++ compiler used in Apple computers these days. It is a very good compiler currently in active
                  development and one of the better compilers for the new features introduced in the C++11 and C++14 standard.
                  The compiler is also very beginner friendly as it has very instructive compile time error messages. It can of
                  course also be installed on all other normal operating systems.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> </p>
                <p>
                  The default C++ compiler used in most Linux distributions these days. One of its biggest advantages is that it
                  will be available in most of the environments you will program in. You can always count in it begin installed on
                  the various servers you might compile your code on.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh386302.aspx">Visual C++</a> </p>
                <p>
                  Finally we have the standard Windows C++ compiler. This will be the default compiler in use if you install one
                  of Microsoft's IDEs such as <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>. Microsoft has until
                  recently been lacking behind with their C++ development, and it wasn't until VS 2015 that they picked up the
                  slack.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Builder</h3>

            <p>
              A good build tool is also important, specifically a tool that can automatically compile your projects and stitch all
              the different parts together into a final executable. It should also be able to distinguish between different builds
              (such a release/debug/testing), and only recompile files that have changed. As with everything else there are a ton
              of options so I will just mention the two most common
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a> </p>
                <p>
                  This is the standard when it comes to build environments, but it is a bit hard to use as it is becoming somewhat
                  outdated. It is easy to use for small programs, but it does not scale that well for larger projects.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most flexible build tools available, it also scales well for large projects. The only thing is that
                  with everything else it also requires some learning to understand, and it might not be available on every server
                  you are working on.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Debugger</h3>

            <p>
              The final point on our list is a good debugger. A debugger is what you use when your program has successfully
              compiled, but it doesn't do what you want it to when you run it, or it crashes unexpectedly.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a> </p>
                <p>
                  Another GNU program, and another Linux default. GDB is a powerful debugger, but it requires some learning to use
                  it effectively. There are also various GUI front ends available for GDB such as GDB's internal TUI, 
                  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">DDD</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Nemiver">Nemiver</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> </p>
                <p>
                  You also have the LLDB, which is a debugger made by the llvm group, the same group who develops the clang
                  compiler. LLDB has a very similar interface to GDB, but is slightly more user friendly and has a cleaner
                  terminal interface. It also introduces practical tools such as automated commands at breakpoint stops.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h2>

            An IDE is basically an application that has all of the features mentioned above bundled into one. There are many great
            IDEs out there, but I will just mention a couple. Just keep in mind that I am a vim addict and therefore
            doesn't have that much of an experience with the advanced functionality of the various IDEs.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a> </p>
                <p>
                  One of the simpler "just go" open source IDEs one can get for Linux and Windows, and it does a fairly good job
                  of getting some of the difficulty out of the way. It does however not have all of the power features some of the
                  paid IDEs have.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> </p>
                <p>
                  Another powerful open source IDE for Linux and Windows. It is slightly more complicated to learn than
                  Code::Blocks, but it is also more powerful in the end if you put in the effort.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a> </p>
                <p>
                  Microsoft's flagship IDE for Windows, and one of the best IDEs out there. The
                  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs">Community edition</a>
                  is free for everyone, and one can get access to higher tiers through MS's
                  <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/">Dreamspark</a> initiative. The C++ development
                  integration might still be lacking, which can be made up for using addons such as
                  <a href="http://www.wholetomato.com">Visual Assist</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
