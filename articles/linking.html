            <h1>Linking your programs</h1>

            At some point in your programming carreer you probably want to include a library other than the standard libraries so
            that you can make use of the work of others. Although it is technically possible to copy external libraries into every
            project you create that needs them, one generally wants to put these libraries in a general location where every
            project can find them and share them. The first time you do this you might then encounter linking errors because you
            don't know how to tell your linker (or compiler) where it can find this new library. This article will address that issue.

            <h2>Local files</h2>

            In the course we covered local linking. That is when you yourself have organised your code into multiple source files,
            and the process of putting all those source files into a single executable is called linking.

            <h3>Header files</h3>

            To include your own header files you have to use the <pre><code class="cpp">#include"file.hpp"</code></pre> macro, where
            the quotation marks signal that the compiler should look for this locally, in the same folder as the source file is
            in. You can of course move around with relative pathing as you would expect, so that e.g. to find a header file in a
            subfolder you could use <pre><code class="cpp">#include"folder/file.hpp"</code></pre>

            <h3>Source files</h3>
            
            To link all your source files together to a single executable we compile the source files into separate object files (machine
            code) first, and then we link them together afterwards. With two source files source1.cpp and source2.cpp, this could
            e.g. be done with the commands

            <pre><code class="cpp">g++ -o source1.o -c source1.cpp
g++ -o source2.o -c source2.cpp
g++ -o program source1.o source2.o</code></pre>

            This can of course be automated with a build system such as make. A simple sample makefile can be found on the
            course's github page:
            <a href="https://github.com/Irubataru/cpp-lecture-2015/blob/master/Utilites/Makefile" target="_blank">Makefile</a>.

            <h2>Shared libraries</h2>

            This far everything is quite easy, but what should we do if we want to include object files from external libraries as
            well as their header files? We need some way of telling our compiler where to find the files we want.

            <h3>Files provided by a shared library</h3>

            <p>
              When downloading a shared library you might notice that it normally comes with two types of files. Header files, which
              are just like the header files you would write yourself, and library files. The library files normally have filetypes
              such as <code class="inline">.a</code> and <code class="inline">.so</code> (and <code class="inline">.dylib</code>
              for OSX). These library files are actually similar to the object files you create when you compile, except that they
              have packaged many of these inside of a single library archive.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are installing an external library on your computer, or your system administrator has installed them for your
              work PC, the shared library files normally end up inside the <code class="inline">/usr</code> hierarchy. This means
              that the header files end up in <code class="inline">/usr/include</code> (possibly in a subfolder), and the library
              files that contain the complied source code end up in <code class="inline">/usr/lib</code>.
            </p> 
            <p>
              E.g. the default install location for the <a href="http://boost.org" target="_blank">boost</a> library is header files in:

              <pre><code>/usr/include/boost</code></pre>

              and the library files are put in

              <pre><code>/usr/lib</code></pre>

              Thus the boost library will install library files such as:

              <pre><code>/usr/lib/libboost_chrono.so
/usr/lib/libboost_filesystem.so
/usr/lib/libboost_regex.so</code></pre>

              and header files such as

              <pre><code>/usr/include/boost/lexical_cast.hpp
/usr/include/boost/filesystem.hpp
/usr/include/boost/regex/regex_traits.hpp</code></pre>
            </p>

            <h3>Including library header files</h3>

            When you want to include system header files in your C++ code you normally write

            <pre><code class="cpp">#include &ltiostream&gt</code></pre>

            <p>
              But where is the <code class="inline">iostream</code> file actually located? It is located in one of the default
              include paths for the compiler. These are of course compiler and system dependent, but it is possible for us to add
              more paths for the compiler to look. Assume for now that you installed the boost library inside of 
              <code class="inline">/home/user/.usr</code>, and in your case this is not a part of your compiler's default search
              path. This means that when you write

              <pre><code class="cpp">#include &ltboost/lexical_cast.hpp&gt</code></pre>

              in your source files, the compiler will complain that it cannot find the file <code class="inline">lexical_cast.hpp</code>
              in any of the directories it looked. We can however fix this by telling the compiler where it can find the file we
              want to include. This can be done with the <code class="inline">-I</code> compiler flag in the following way:

              <pre><code>g++ -o source.o -c -I/home/user/.usr/include source.cpp</code></pre>

              This goes into the compilation step of building your program, so the moment you are creating the object files that
              later will be linked. You can of course specify multiple extra locations for the compiler to look by simply chaining
              these <code class="inline">-I</code> flags

              <pre><code>g++ -o source.o -c -I/home/user/.usr/include -I/opt/boost/include source.cpp</code></pre>
            </p>

            <h3>Linking with shared libraries</h3>

            <p>
              So far we have been able to include the header files so that we can get the library's function and class declarations
              into our program. The next issue is that when you then later try to link your program, the linker will complain that
              it can't find the definitions of the functions you got from the header files. This is because the libraries object
              files (these <code class="inline">.a</code> and <code class="inline">.so</code> files) haven't been linked with our
              own object files yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first naive thing that might come to your mind is to simply add these library files to the linking command, so
              that linking with a boost module could be written as

              <pre><code>g++ -o program source1.o source2.o /usr/lib/libboost_regex.so</code></pre>

              This does actually work, however it is a bit tedious, and not very portable if you want to compile your program on
              different platforms. The solution the compiler provides us is implemented with two flags: 
              <code class="inline">-l</code> and <code class="inline">-L</code>. <code class="inline">-l</code> is simply a
              convenience flag for the compiler, and is a way it contract filenames. The compiler expects all library files to be named
              either <code class="inline">lib*.a</code> or <code class="inline">lib*.so</code> (or something similar), and thus
              the flag <code class="inline">-lboost_regex</code> is just a shorthand for the file name
              <code class="inline">libboost_regex.so</code>
            </p>

            <p>
              So with this flag we can tell the compiler which library file to link, but we still need to tell it where to look
              for the files. Symmetric to how the <code class="inline">-I</code> flag works, the <code class="inline">-L</code>
              flag tells the linker where to look for the library files. Thus if we wanted to link the boost regex library to our
              program, and we had installed boost in <code class="inline">/home/user/.usr</code>, we could write

              <pre><code>g++ -o program -L/home/user/.usr/lib source1.o source2.o -lboost_regex</code></pre>

              Notice here that the <code class="inline">-l</code> and <code class="inline">-L</code> flags are flags for the
              linker, not the compiler, so we can leave these out when compiling our own sources.
