### Course Description ###

This course provides an introduction to the C++ programming language, and aims at establishing a solid foundation
on which students can stand on when tackling more advanced topics in the futute. The primary focus of the lecture
is to prepare the students for the "Computational Physics" course taught in the winter semester. Although having
prior experience in any programming language will facilitate the learning process, students from all backgrounds
and disciplines are welcome to attend. On top of the lectures themselves, the course will have a large practical
component where the students themselves will have to use C++ to solve various problems.

The course will cover the following topics:

 * The basics of programming
 * Tools and compilers
 * Data types, pointers and references
 * C++ memory management
 * Control structures and functions
 * Exception handling
 * Classes, inheritance and polymorphism
