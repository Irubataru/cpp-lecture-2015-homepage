            <h1>Exercises Day 3</h1>

            <h2>Problem 1: Matrix and vector classes</h2>

            <p>
              In this exercise we will create two classes, <code class="cpp inline">Vector</code> and
              <code class="cpp inline">Matrix</code>, that can carry out basic array functionality as
              well as the mathematical operations we expect from such objects.
            </p>

            <ul class="task-list">
              <li>Create the two classes in question and set up their data stucture (privately)</li>
              <li>Write suitable constructors and destructors</li>
              <li>
                <p>Create some sort of access operators, how would you solve that for the matrix?</p>
                <p><em>Advanced:</em> </p>
                <p>
                Create a <code class="cpp inline">VectorView</code> class to read 
                individual rows of the matrix, use this class to recreate the <code class="cpp inline">[][]</code>
                syntax of normal multidimensional arrays
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Create <code class="cpp inline">.size()</code> and <code class="cpp inline">.resize(...)</code>
              </li>
              <li>Make some convinient filling functions, such as zero to zero, or the identity</li>
              <li>
                Add other functions you feel your objects should have, such as <code class="cpp inline">.norm()</code>
                and <code class="cpp inline">.transpose()</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                Now it is time to overload the various arithmetic operators, <code class="cpp inline">+, -, *, /</code>
                </p>
                <p>How does this work with combined expressions? <code class="cpp inline">(a+b)*c</code></p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Problem 2: Address book</h2>

            <p>
              In this exercise we will implement an address book where all the entries are sorted based on the
              contact's name. To store the addresses we will create a linked list storage class.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Create the <code class="cpp inline">AddressBookEntry</code> class / struct. Every address should
                at least have a name, and address and a phone number. Decide how you want to store the various
                pieces of information and which ones you feel are important
              </li>
              <li>Implement the necessary boolean operators so that you can later compare entries</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Next we will make the linked list to store the entries. A linked list consists of two classes.
              The overlying control structure that will manage the list interface
              (<code class="cpp inline">LinkedList</code>), and nodes that contain the linked list data 
              (<code class="cpp inline">LinkedListNode</code>).  The liked list doesn't keep an array of
              the nodes, only the first node of the list, then every node contains its data along with some
              sort of way to pointing to the next node in the chain.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Create the <code class="cpp inline">LinkedListNode</code> class and give it data, a member
                function to access the underlying data as well as <code class="cpp inline">.next()</code>
                and <code class="cpp inline">.last()</code> functions
              </li>
              <li>
                Create the <code class="cpp inline">LinkedList</code> class that work as an outer interface
                and enables functionality such as <code class="cpp inline">.insert()</code>,
                <code class="cpp inline">.remove()</code>, <code class="cpp inline">.search()</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Adapt this to work for you <code class="cpp inline">AddressBook</code> class so that you have
                a working address book that is sorted and can be manipulated
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Problem 3: Minesweeper</h2>

            <p>
              Finally we will implement a terminal based minesweeper game. There are many ways of structuring
              your code to implement this, but here are a couple of classes you can start out with:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A <code class="cpp inline">Minesweeper</code> class that encapsulates the game. It should be
                able to parse input and make those into commands on the game board. It should also manage looping
                until a win or loose condition is met along with tying the other parts of the game together
              </li>
              <li>
                A <code class="cpp inline">MinesweeperBoard</code> class that keeps track of the mines on the
                board as well as the mine adjacency number (the one that says how many mines surround an empty tile)
              </li>
              <li>
                A <code class="cpp inline">MinesweeperMask</code> class that works as a mask in top of the board.
                It is the layer that is between the board and the player and it contains information such as whether
                a tile is open or closed as well as whether the player has made a guess on the tile
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Sit down and think about how these objects would interact with each other before you start programming,
              and as you write code you might realise that more helper classes could be useful (e.g. a separate IO layer). 
            </p>

            <p>
              <em> Advanced:</em> If you have played minesweeper before, you know that if you open a tile that has no
              adjacent mines, the game will automatically also open all adjacent tiles. How can you implement a similar
              feature in your program using recursion?
            </p>

            <p>
            <em> Advanced:</em> Another feature you might want is the option to "control click" an opened tile. In
            minesweeper this works so that if a tile has the number one on it, and you as a player has made a
            sufficient amount of guesses around it, the game will open all the other nodes for you. This is also
            a cascading effect.
            </p>
